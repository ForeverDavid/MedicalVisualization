# MedicalVisualization

An interactive visualization and editing system for medical images/data(DICOM) that would also serve as a front-end for 3D printing medically precise objects which could be used in implants or surgery planning. Import and render medical voxel data. Extract iso-surfaces, run geometric algorithms to analyze the surface mesh and send tessellated data to the 3D printer. 

Libraries and frameworks used : VTK, Qt
